# WebGIS Assignment 4 - Leaflet Web Maps
## Author: Jonathan Munroe

This repository contains interactive web maps built with Leaflet.js demonstrating real-time geospatial data visualization.

## Combined Weather & Earthquake Map
An advanced interactive map that combines both weather alerts and earthquake data with toggle controls:  
- **Toggle Control Switch**: Switch between weather alerts, earthquake data, and precipitation radar  
- **Real-time Weather Alerts**: Color-coded severity levels with detailed popups  
- **Live Earthquake Data**: Magnitude-based markers with comprehensive information  
- **Precipitation Radar**: Real-time weather radar overlay  
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time loading status for each data layer

## Earthquake Map
A real-time earthquake monitoring map displaying:  
- Global earthquake data from the past 24 hours (USGS)  
- Magnitude-based marker styling with colors and sizes  
- Detailed popups showing magnitude, location, time, and depth  
- Interactive legend explaining earthquake severity levels  

**Magnitude Scale:**
- ðŸŸ¢ 0.0-2.9: Minor earthquakes
- ðŸŸ¡ 3.0-3.9: Light earthquakes  
- ðŸŸ  4.0-4.9: Moderate earthquakes
- ðŸ”¶ 5.0-5.9: Strong earthquakes
- ðŸ”´ 6.0-6.9: Major earthquakes
- ðŸ”´ 7.0+: Great earthquakes
